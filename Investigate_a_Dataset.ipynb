    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between discount percentage and average product rating ?\n",
    "- The relationship is weak negative between discount percentage and average product rating.\n",
    "- Lower-rated products often have higher discount, while higher-rate products seem not have significantly impact.\n",
    "2. Do products with more reviews have higher or lower average ratings?\n",
    "- There is a weak positive relationship between the number of reviews and average product ratings. Products with more reviews tend to have slightly higher ratings, but the effect is small.\n",
    "- Products with more reviews tend to have tighter rating distributions, suggesting that increased visibility may lead to more consistent ratings, potentially due to a larger and more diverse customer base.\n",
    "- Higher review counts have a stronger positive impact on lower-rated products, potentially helping improve their ratings slightly. However, for \"Excellent\" rated products, the effect of additional reviews on rating is minimal or even slightly negative.\n",
    "3. Do higher-priced products receive better ratings than lower-priced ones?\n",
    "- Higher-priced products receive better ratings than lower-priced products, but the difference is minimal, indicating that price alone is not a major determinant of product rating.\n",
    "- Higher-priced products show slightly more consistent ratings (lower standard deviation), suggesting that customers may have more stable expectations for higher-priced items.\n",
    "- The weak positive correlation between price and rating within both groups implies that customers slightly favor higher-priced products, but this effect is minor and likely influenced by other factors such as product quality or brand reputation.\n",
    "4. Do Products with Positive Sentiment in Reviews Have Higher Ratings?\n",
    "- Products with positive sentiment in reviews tend to have higher ratings compared to those with neutral or negative sentiment, confirming that sentiment is a useful indicator of product rating.\n",
    "- The ANOVA test confirms that these differences are statistically significant, suggesting that the sentiment expressed in reviews is a meaningful predictor of product rating.\n",
    "- For businesses, encouraging positive customer sentiment in reviews can positively impact product ratings. This highlights the importance of customer satisfaction and quality in maintaining high ratings.\n",
    "5. Which Categories of Products Receive the Highest or Lowest Ratings?\n",
    "- Computers & Accessories has the highest average rating (4.16), suggesting that this category generally has a higher level of customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- Home & Kitchen has the lowest average rating among the analyzed categories, though the difference is minimal, indicating that all three categories generally receive favorable ratings.\n",
    "- In Electronics and Computers & Accessories, lower-rated products tend to have higher discounts, which may indicate a strategy to boost sales or attractiveness despite lower customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- Home & Kitchen shows a unique pattern where low-rated products actually benefit in ratings with higher discounts, as indicated by the positive correlation for Low ratings.\n",

    "- This source might not represent a comprehensive and unbiased sample of all movies. It is possible that some genres of movies are not represented.\n",
    "- The correlation does not imply causation. It will need more experiments and statistical analyses. The findings in this analysis provide associations but should not be interpreted as causal relationships."
